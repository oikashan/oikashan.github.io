Hi, I'm Kashan, a Frontend Software Engineer from Pakistan. In 2018, I developed my first website using HTML, CSS, and PHP. Since then, for the past 5 years, I have been developing websites and web apps. 

I have worked with an [amazing ecommerce website](https://how2pass.com/), an [Ed-tech startup](https://thetutor.me/), a [digital agency](https://tentwenty.me/), and as a teacher at an [academy](https://itcentre.pk/). I have also worked as a freelancer on Fiverr.

My goal is to deliver aesthetic, accessible, animated websites that also load quickly, are SEO-ready, and drive conversions. I'm fluent in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**, and **TS**, and I've mastered the art of **responsive design**, **accessibility**,  **animations**, **serverless**, and **API integration**.

**React, Next.js, Astro, Tailwind, Sass, Firebase, Supabase, CI/CD, AWS, Git, NPM,** you name it, I've used it. If I haven't, I go by the mindset of a learner. I'll learn it, and I learn by building, which is fast.

Every year, I set a new challenge for myself in a completely new environment. **In 2023, the challenge was to master the art of creating animated yet accessible websites.** Not only did I succeed in mastering the art, but I also secured a job at a digital agency that specialized in this very niche.

**Currently, I'm on a quest to join a team that values my talent and gives me an opportunity to learn and grow.**
