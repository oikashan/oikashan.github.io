Aman Lil Afia Clinic is a clinic in Dubai, UAE. The website showcases their services and their team. The team at Aman came to Tentwenty with nothing but a logo and a vision. We worked with them to create a website that is both beautiful and functional. My job was to follow the design and create the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while using a CMS called [Concrete](https://www.concretecms.com/) which is based on PHP and MySQL.

## Problem

The problem I encountered first and foremost past the design phase was the CMS. Concrete is a CMS that is not very popular and has a very small community. This meant that there was not a lot of documentation and I had to figure out a lot of things on our own. The CMS was also very slow, which is not something you want in a portfolio website, and the client wanted a beautiful, animated website. This meant that I had to find a way to make the website fast, beautiful, and functional.

But, you'd wish that were all the problems I had. The client also wanted to be able to edit the website themselves, which meant that I had to make the website as easy to edit as possible. This meant that I had to create a lot of custom blocks and make sure that the client could edit the website without breaking it.

It doesn't end there, though. The client also wanted to be able to edit the website in Arabic, which meant that I had to make sure that the website was fully translatable and that the client could edit the website in both English and Arabic.

## Solution

The first thing I did was to make sure that the website was as fast as possible. I took a few initial steps to ensure I don't go off track nor does anyone else in the future.

- I made sure that the images and videos were optimized, organized, and lazy-loaded.
  - For this, I had to develop a minimal lazy loader that would load the files only when they were in the viewport.
- I wrapped the static assets in webpack and added minification and compression to ensure the smallest possible file size.
- I used Tailwind CSS to ensure I don't ship any unused CSS + have a fast development experience.
- I kept the use of JS libraries to a minimum and only used them when necessary, which was only for the sliders.

The next thing I did was to make sure that the website was as easy to edit as possible. I did this by creating custom blocks for the CMS and making sure that the client could edit the website without breaking it. I also made sure that the client could edit the website in both English and Arabic.

## Result

The result was a beautiful, fast, and functional website that the client could edit without breaking it. The client was very happy with the result and Tentwenty. The website is currently live and can be viewed [here](https://amanlilafiaclinic.ae/en/).

## What did I learn?

This project was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about how to make a website fast and how to make a website easy to edit. I also learned a lot about how to work with a CMS and how to make sure that the client can edit the website without breaking it. I also learned a lot about how to work with a team and how to make sure that everyone is on the same page.
