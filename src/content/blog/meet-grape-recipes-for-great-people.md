Introducing Grape: üçá Great Recipes for Great People.
Grape is my latest and finest creation (so far). It's a collection of recipes (currently) for everyone. It's a place where you can lookup recipes, macros, ingredients, equipment, and instructions. Currently, it's in its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, with just the most functional requirements. The goal for it is to be the *Last Fitness App You'll Ever Need*. It's a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Ionic, React, and TypeScript. Ionic builds hybrid apps, so it's available on the web, and it's available on the App Store and the Play Store. It's also open-source, so you can check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/thekayshawn/grapes-pwa).

## Why Grape?

The main problem Grape will solve is the need to have multiple apps just to track your meals and workouts and learn recipes and whatnot. Grape will be the *Last Fitness App You'll Ever Need*. It'll have everything you need to track your meals and workouts, and it'll have a collection of recipes for you to try out. It'll also have a community where you can share your recipes and workouts with others. It'll be a place where you can learn about nutrition and fitness and health. In the current stage, Grape has the following features:

- [x] Recipes
- [x] Ingredients
- [x] Equipment
- [x] Instructions
- [x] Macros
- [x] Search

## What's next?

All the above were what I considered Phase 1 or the MVP phase. I have the whole roadmap available to the public right [here](https://sassywares.notion.site/Grape-Roadmap-4157ef32a3f6497c8e2cbe993f36c6d2). I'll be working on the next phase soon, which will include:

- [ ] Advanced search
- [ ] Personalized recommendations
- [ ] Way more recipes
- [ ] Livelier UI
- [ ] Per recipe ratings and reviews
- [ ] Meal Planning
- [ ] User Profiles

## Development

Grape is open-source, the backend is a pretty simplistic PHP and MySQL API, and the frontend is a PWA built with Ionic, React, and TypeScript. You can check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/thekayshawn/grapes-pwa). If you want to contribute, please do. I'll be more than happy to accept your contributions. I'll also be shipping a UI to add recipes soon, so stay tuned for that if you wanna contribute to the database.

## How can I help?

I'm glad you asked. There are a few ways you can help:

- [ ] Spread the word
- [ ] Contribute to the codebase
- [ ] Contribute to the database (Coming soon)
