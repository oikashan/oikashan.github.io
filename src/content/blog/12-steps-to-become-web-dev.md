## 1. Understand the Basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Never underestimate the power of the basics. Begin by grasping the fundamental building blocks of web development - HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. These languages form the backbone of web development. Mastering them will give you a solid foundation to build upon. Do not rush this step. Most wanna-be web developers make the mistake of skipping the basics and jumping straight into frameworks and libraries. This is a recipe for disaster. You will end up with a shaky foundation and struggle to understand the underlying concepts. Take your time to learn the basics well. It will pay off in the long run and people with a strong side-eye will notice the difference.

## 2. Learn Version Control (Git)

I don't know how many "React Developers" I've met who didn't even know how to use Git. That's like a chef who doesn't know how to use a knife. Familiarize yourself with Git. And Git doesn't mean GitHub, it's an independant software. Learn how to use Git from the command line. It's super easy and the best way to learn it is to use it. Download git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and then follow this [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control). Once you're done with that, learn how to use GitHub. Create a GitHub account and then follow this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). This is one of the most crucial steps in becoming a software engineer and it's often overlooked. Don't make that mistake.

## 3. Explore Front-End Development

The recipe of recipes, the holy grail of web development, the front-end. This is the spot where most folks lose their cool, and it's not even their fault (well, mostly). The world of front-end is toasted beyond recognition, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Let me show you a simple yet fool-proof path towards front-end development in 2024 and beyond.

1. If you've done the first 2 steps, you're already a front-end developer. Good, [you're amongst 75%](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2022/#key-takeaways) of the world's software engineers, time to climb the ranks.
2. Learn UX/UI designing, just a few basics, nothing too fancy. You'll be working with Figma more than often and a good sense of User Experience and User Interface will help you a lot in being a better front-end developer. This year is going to be all about user-centric design, so you better get on the train. [Here's a good article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ui-ux-design-tutorial-from-zero-to-hero-with-wireframe-prototype-figma/) to get you started.
3. The next step is to master HTML. Let's break it down.
    - **Semantic Elements:** Learn about semantic elements and how to use them. [Here's a good article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/semantic-html5-elements/) to get you started.
    - **Accessibility:** HTML is a markup language, markup is presented to everyone, including people with disabilities. Learn how to make your markup accessible to everyone. [Here's a good article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-accessibility-best-practices/) to get you started.
    - **SEO:** Probably the most frustrating part yet the most rewarding part of HTML is SEO. Learn how to make your markup SEO friendly as well how to keep up with Google's ever-changing SEO algorithms. [Here's a good article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tips-to-boost-your-seo/) to get you started.
4. Now, time to learn a few CSS utilities. If you're still not comfortable with CSS, please practice more. Your only race is with yourself and you're the only one who can win it. Once you're comfortable with CSS, come back here.
    - **Bootstrap:** You'll hear many things about Bootstrap, but you're not the one to idolize a library nor ignore its importance. Bootstrap once ruled the world of CSS, most of your future jobs will require at least a basic understanding of Bootstrap. Learn how to use Bootstrap and how to customize it. [Here's a good article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-bootstrap-4-in-30-minute-by-building-a-landing-page-website-guide-for-beginners-f64e03833f33/) to get you started.
    - **Tailwind:** Tailwind is the new Bootstrap, except it's not Bootstrap, but a complete game changer. Bootstrap comes with a lot of pre-built components, Tailwind doesn't. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides you with a lot of utilities to build your own components. The strength of Tailwind lies in the fact that you almost never have to write CSS again. But, this is only viable if you already know CSS. Learn how to use Tailwind and how to customize it. [The official docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) are the best place to get started.
    - **Sass:** Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which means it's a CSS compiler. I've done more programming with Sass than I remember, it's that good. Learn how to use Sass and how to customize it. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/) is here to save the day.
5. The mother of all languages, the one and only JavaScript. The thing about JavaScript is that there's just too much information out there. It's easier to get distracted with a new framework than it is to learn JavaScript. Here's a viable shortcut.
    - **Vanilla JS:** Learn Vanilla JS, it's the best way to learn JavaScript. The stronger the base, the stronger the building. [Build 7 video games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc) with Vanilla JS, it's possible and it's fun, and you can showcase it on your portfolio.
    - **NPM and Node:** Before you go anywhere further, you'll have to learn how to use NPM, a package manager for Node.js. All of JavaScript's frameworks require you to use NPM, except a select few. Just learn a few basics and you'll be good to go. [Here's a really awesome article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/).
    - **React:** There are many frameworks out there, but you don't wanna waste your time anywhere. React is the most used, most popular, most in-demand JavaScript framework, even though it calls itself a library. This is the step where you'll get the most frustrated with all the TED-talk going around you on whether React is a good choice or not. But, believe me, if you have your basics strong, React is the most rewarding framework out there. Besides, you can always switch to something else later on if you so desire, but do not even try in the beginning. Keep yourself focused. No better place to learn React than [the official docs](https://react.dev/).
Now, I would like to move your compass a bit further but I won't. Mastering React will allow you to explore more horizons by yourself. You'll be able to make your own decisions and you'll be able to make them wisely. So, I'll leave you here. But, before I go, I'd like to tell you that you're not done with front-end development yet. There's still a lot to learn.

## 4. Master Back-End Technologies

Now now, what better way to start a Monday than to learn some back-end technologies. Back-end development is a whole different world, it's the work that nobody sees, but it makes the whole world go round. Servers, Databases, Deployments, APIs, and whatnot. Let's get started.

The first thing is to choose a Back-End language. If you're already familiar with JavaScript, you're all set. If not, you'll have to learn a new language. Here are a few options, and then I'll tell you which one to choose.

- **PHP:** PHP is like a zombie that refuses to die, it's been around for a long time and it's not going anywhere. It's easy to learn and it's easy to use. But it doesn't have a bright future. If you're looking for a quick buck, PHP is the way to go. But, if you're looking for a long-term career, PHP is not the way to go.

- **Python:** Python is the future, side-by-side with JavaScript. 2023 was the year of AI, guess what else it was a year of? Python. Almost all of the AI and ML work is done in Python. For web, Python has a really strong framework called Django. You gotta make a choice.

- **Ruby:** Ruby is like a diamond, it's rare, it's beautiful, and it's expensive. Ruby is the language of choice for many big companies, including GitHub. Ruby has a really strong framework called Ruby on Rails. The thing about Rails is that nobody learns it anymore, yet it powers a lot of the web. You can land really good jobs with Ruby, but you'll have to learn it by yourself.

- **Java & C#:** Now, both of these have really good, enterprise-level frameworks called Spring and ASP.NET respectively. But, both of these frameworks are mostly only used for enterprise-level software development. If you're looking for a job in a big company, these are the languages to go for.

Now, time to choose. The decision is yours, I'll tell you the pros and cons of each.

If you're looking to start fast and land a job fast, go for PHP. If you're looking for a long-term career, go for Python or JavaScript, both of these will be there for a long time. If you're looking for a job in a big company, go for Java or C#. If you're looking to earn high yet learn something extraordinary, go for Ruby.

If I were you, I'd write down my situation and then make a decision. I'd write down where I stand and what exactly I want to do. Then, I'd make a decision based on that. To clarify a little, this was just the first step of web development, there's a lot more to come.

## 5. Database Knowledge

Now, you can't just build a website and not store data in it. You'll have to learn how to store data in a database. There are 2 types of databases, relational and non-relational. Relational databases use SQL and non-relational databases use JSON Documents. The goal is to learn how databases work, not master all of them. A general workflow looks like this.

1. Learn what databases are.
2. Learn the difference between relational and non-relational databases.
3. Learn how to connect your back-end to a database.
4. Learn how to perform CRUD operations on a database.
5. Learn how to secure your database.
6. Learn optimization, scaling, and caching.

Now, this is just the beginning, there's a lot to come. You won't need much more for a Back-End Developer job, but you'll need a lot more for a Database Administrator job. So, keep that in mind.

## 6. APIs and RESTful Services

Now, you can't just build a website and not communicate with it. You'll have to learn how to communicate with your website. APIs are like the waiters in a restaurant, they take your order and bring you your food.

If you're a Back-End Developer, you'll have to learn how to create APIs. If you're a Front-End Developer, you'll have to learn how to consume APIs. If you're a Full-Stack Developer, you'll have to learn both. If you're a Database Administrator, you'll have to learn how to secure APIs.

At a beginner level, you'll only need to learn about Restful Services. But, as you progress, you'll have to learn about GraphQL and gRPC as well. But, that's a story for another day.

On the front-end, this would mean API Integration and dynamic content. JavaScript has built-in support for requesting data from across the internet.

## 7. Security Best Practices

A common misconception is that security is the responsibility of the back-end developer. This is not true. Security is the responsibility of everyone involved in the development process. Familiarize yourself with web security practices. Learn about common vulnerabilities and how to protect against them, including topics like HTTPS, input validation, and secure authentication.

## 8. DevOps and Deployment

Understand the basics of DevOps, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Learn how to deploy and manage web applications on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Netlify. Even as a Front-End Developer, you will need to know how to deploy your applications so that you can showcase them to the world.

## 9. Testing and Debugging

Learn how to debug your code. Learn how to use the browser's developer tools to inspect and debug your code. Embrace testing methodologies. Learn about unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure the robustness and reliability of your code.

## 10. Stay Updated and Build an Online Presence

Web development is an ever-evolving field. Keep yourself updated with the latest trends and technologies. Regularly work on personal or open-source projects to apply and solidify your knowledge. A common misconception is that you need to work on popular open source projects or keep your GitHub activity streak going. This is not true. Focus on quality over quantity. Build projects that you are passionate about and that you can showcase to the world. Keep engaging with the community and build an online presence. This will help you stay motivated and keep you accountable, as well as make job hunting easier.

## 11. Soft Skills and Collaboration

Develop soft skills such as effective communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. These skills are crucial for collaborating with other developers, designers, and stakeholders. But Kashan, I'm an introvert, I don't like talking to people. Well, I'm an introvert too, but I still talk to people. You don't have to be an extrovert to talk to people, you just have to be a human. If you're a human, you can talk to people. If you're not a human, you can still talk to people, but you'll have to learn how to talk to people first. That last line was generated by Copilot, dude sucks at jokes.

The key is to practice more, the greatest of victories lie beyond the greatest of challenges. You might fear talking to people, but you'll never know how good it feels to talk to people until you talk to people. So, go out there and talk to people. You'll be surprised how many people are just like you, they just hide it better.

## 12. Specialize and Keep Learning

As you gain experience, consider specializing in a particular area, such as front-end development, back-end development, or DevOps. Specialization can enhance your expertise and career opportunities. Everything I wrote above is about the first step into each of the fields. There's a lot more to learn in each of the fields. But, if you try to learn everything at once, you'll end up learning nothing. So, take it one step at a time. Learn the basics, then learn the advanced stuff, then learn the expert stuff, then learn the master stuff, then learn the god stuff, then learn the Kashan stuff. You get the point. (Dude, this is getting out of hand, I'm gonna have to talk to GitHub about this.)

## 13. Bonus: Use AI to assist you

The year 2023 was the year of AI, and 2024 will be the year of products. Making software has never been easier, so is learning. Use AI to learn faster and better. Leverage the power of AI to assist you in your journey. Use AI to generate code, use AI to generate content, use AI to generate ideas, use AI to generate anything you want. AI is the future, and the future is now. There's one catch though. With the ease of AI, everyone will be able to make things, but not everyone can make communities and solid, personalized persona. So, if you wanna be a successful web developer in 2024, you'll have to make a community and a solid, personalized persona. You'll have to make a name for yourself, and you'll have to do it now.

## Conclusion

Web development is a vast field. It is impossible to learn everything. The key is to focus on the fundamentals and build upon them. Keep yourself updated with the latest trends and technologies. Keep learning and keep building. The journey is long, but the rewards are worth it.

Until next time, keep learning, keep building, and keep moving forward.
