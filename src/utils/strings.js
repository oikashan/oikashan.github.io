    "Hey there! I've been creating user-friendly websites since 2018. I'm a software engineer from Pakistan who taught myself JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP. I enjoy working on open-source projects and have completed several. I love exploring the capabilities of the web and am always up for learning new things.",
    "Recently, I did something pretty coolâ€”I built a 3D spaceship that actually moves in the browser using React, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS. And get this, when you click a link, the ship hyperdrives to a whole new page. It's a fun way to make web browsing a bit more interesting!",
